# Rust-C Interoperability Demo

This project demonstrates how to call C code from Rust, showcasing the interoperability between these two languages.

## Overview

This demo project illustrates:
- How to create and use C functions in Rust
- Setting up the necessary build configuration
- Handling data types between C and Rust
- Managing memory safety across the language boundary

## Project Structure

The project contains:
- C source files (`.c` and `.h`)
- Rust source files (`.rs`)
- Build configuration files

## Building and Running

[Build and run instructions will be added as the project develops]

## Requirements

- Rust toolchain
- C compiler (gcc/clang)
- [Additional requirements will be added as needed]

## Safety Considerations

When calling C code from Rust, it's important to:
- Properly handle unsafe code blocks
- Manage memory correctly across the language boundary
- Validate data types and conversions
- Handle potential null pointers and undefined behavior
